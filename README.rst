  DAILP Ingest
================================================================================

This repository contains scripts for ingesting DAILP Cherokee data into the
DAILP Cherokee OLD.

Note: this repository does *not* contain any Cherokee data. This script assumes
that certain specific files are in a sister directory to ingest/ named inputs/.
If these files are not present or if their contents are not what the main
script expects them to be, then the ingest will fail.


Next Steps
================================================================================

1. Clean up current ingest script as per Jeff's instructions.

   - Doc with instructions:
     https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MtsPkfe7PyNo58Rps8fpYAdTdj65QtexO_BbBJVtK4M/edit

     Does this mean that the tags on the OLD forms like "pp-set:ka:", "pp-set:a", etc. need to be changed?

2. Ingest Affix datasets (see document; TODO)

   - Doc with instructions:
     https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MtsPkfe7PyNo58Rps8fpYAdTdj65QtexO_BbBJVtK4M/edit

3. Ingest surface forms from the other tense/aspect classes in Liwen's
   spreadsheet. Get input from Jeff during or first.
